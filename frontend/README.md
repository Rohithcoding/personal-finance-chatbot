## File Structure

```
frontend/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main HTML structure
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css          # CSS styling and responsive design
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js           # JavaScript functionality
â””â”€â”€ README.md          # This documentation
```

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Run with Flask API Server (Recommended)

From the project root directory:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the Flask API server (serves both API and frontend)
python api_server.py
```

Visit: http://localhost:8000

### Option 2: Serve Static Files

You can serve the frontend files directly using any web server:

```bash
# Using Python's built-in server
cd frontend
python -m http.server 8080

# Using Node.js (if you have it installed)
npx serve .

# Using PHP (if you have it installed)  
php -S localhost:8080
```

Note: When serving static files, the backend API integration won't work. The frontend will run in demo mode with fallback responses.

## API Integration

The frontend is designed to work with the Flask API server (`api_server.py`) which provides:

- `/health` - API status check
- `/chat` - Chat message processing
- Static file serving

When the API is not available, the frontend gracefully falls back to demo mode with predefined responses.

## Browser Support

- Chrome 70+
- Firefox 65+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+

## Dependencies

- Font Awesome 6.0 (icons)
- Inter font (typography)
- Modern CSS features (Grid, Flexbox, CSS Variables)
- ES6+ JavaScript features

All external dependencies are loaded via CDN, so no additional installation is required.

## Development

For development with hot-reload and debugging:

```bash
# Set Flask to development mode
export FLASK_ENV=development

# Run the API server
python api_server.py
```

This enables:
- Auto-restart on code changes
- Detailed error messages
- Debug logging in browser console
